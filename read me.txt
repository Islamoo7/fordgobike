4- Summary: After drawing some visuals we reached to these insights,
- The numbers of subscribers is much higher than the number of customers may be related for the everyday use of people so subscribtion is easier.
- All genders have approxmatily the average number of duration.
- Younger people ride more than older people maybe because they healthier.
- Subscribers have shorter trip duration than customers.

5- Key insghits: First, I Found that people tend to subscribe than to be a customer. 
Second, After drawing a violin plot I found that average trip duration for all genders is equal and between 7 and 15 minutes
Third, that younger people have health advantage so they ride more than older peole.
and finally, Subscribers spend shorter time in trips due to the fact they may ride everyday to work or as sport so their
trip duration may be short.
